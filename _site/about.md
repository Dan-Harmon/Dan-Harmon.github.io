**Howdy Howdy!** Welcome to my blog. I'm a second year CS and Math undergrad at Penn State. My academic interests are focused largely on mathematical modeling and operations research.
    
I'll probably fill this with math and sciency stuff I'm thinking about. Might also toss in some political stuff here and there, depends on the vibe.
    
I basically one-to-one copied the style of this site from [another cool blog](theconfused.me) I found crawling the web. I'll probably fix that at some point.
