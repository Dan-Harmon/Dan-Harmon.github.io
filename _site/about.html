    <p><b>Howdy Howdy!</b> Welcome to my blog. I'm a second year CS and Math undergrad at Penn State. My academic interests are focused largely on mathematical modeling and operations research.</p>
       
<p>I plan to fill this with math and sciency stuff I'm thinking about. Might also toss in some political stuff here and there, depends on the vibe.</p>
    
<p>I basically one-to-one copied the style of this site from <a href="https://theconfused.me">another cool blog</a> I found crawling the web. I'll probably fix that at some point.</p>
